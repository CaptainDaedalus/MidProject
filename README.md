Content
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

Findings:
- 2016 seems to be the most popular year of guests arriving, however 2016 is the only year containing all 12 months
- 1-4 nights is the most common amount of nights spent at the hotels
- There was a relatively large number of cancellations made with no deposits made for those cancellations
- Most popular way to advertise and receive bookings were through travel agancies and travel agents, both online and offline
- Country of origin for the guests were Portugal, followed by the UK and France
- The vast majority of guests preferred bead and breakfast as their meal plan for both hotels
- The most common amount of adults per booking were 2, while the most common amount of children per booking was 0.
- The mean Average Daily Rate (ADR) was 107.74 for both Hotels, while 2016 saw an increase of monthly ADR as compared to 2015 for the City Hotel.

Next step:
- a good next step would be to create a prediction model with ADR as the dependent variable
